HackOTR was the first open community hackathon hosted by the Brandery, a nonprofit startup accelerator in Cincinnati, Ohio. Together with the other Brandterns, I played a central role in planning, promoting, and running the hackathon. {{< read-more-button >}}

I also created a website to promote the event and orient interested hackers. This included the refinement of a brand and visual language that guided my design of the website, as well as for the T-shirts that were designed and distributed to all hackers in attendance.

I designed and built a one-page, responsive site that included the basic event information, an F.A.Q., an event schedule, and a section to identify sponsors. Registration and attendee management was handled through EventBrite.

The first HackOTR was a succees, drawing in about 50 hackers, designers, and marketing specialists for 24 hours of coding, creating, and fun. Sponsors included' The Brandery, Cincinnati Bell, Cintrifuse, and 3CDC:
