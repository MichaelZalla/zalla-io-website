As part of my Interaction Design I studio course, I was challenged to design an interactive music player for a specific music artist and album. I chose to create a player to suit Jack Johnson's 2005 album [*In Between Dreams*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Between_Dreams). {{< read-more-button >}}

Following Jack's soft, friendly music, my player serves the casual listener, allowing both the uninitiated user and familiar fan to explore the musician's sound and background in a peaceful and unobtrusive setting.

Preliminary concept sketches and visual explorations led to my development of a pixel-perfect sequence of screen designs, refined through user testing. A working native desktop application was built with Flash CS5 and the Adobe AIR runtime. I wrote the application in ActionScript 3.0, taking a class-based approach to code organization.
