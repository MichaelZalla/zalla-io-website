During my summer internship at the Cimarron Group in Los Angeles, I dedicated some downtime to a personal project: developing a light, inviting identity for a fictitious social networking platform (read—"shameless Twitter clone") named Shout!. {{< read-more-button >}}

This was an excercise in the consistent use of a single visual aesthetic across several pages of an information space.

I used the completed visual designs to build out several pages in the browser, and took the opportunity to write a user registration and login system, complete with password hashing, password reset, and notification emails. User information was processed with PHP and stored in a MySQL database using PHP's MySQL API—the same API has since been deprecated in favor of the MySQLi and PDO_MySQL drivers.

This marked one of my earliest experiences with backend programming and relational databases.
