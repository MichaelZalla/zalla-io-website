There is a subset of frequent online gamers who value play that is both balanced and socially meaningful. However, these same gamers are often limited to automated, in-game matchmaking solutions that lack the functionality to support persistent, socially-linked teams and the scheduling of voluntarily accepted matches with other teams. {{< read-more-button >}}

The Tag Network is a concept for a user-driven information platform. The purpose of the platform is to encourage competition by providing users with the ability to freely associate with user-defined teams, enabling them to organize and track their own competitive 'pick-up games'. By using the platform, players can define an identity not only for themselves, but for their teams as organized entities.

For this project, I developed a structure and aesthetic for a data-driven website. In order to create Tag, I followed a comprehensive approach to information design involving competitor research, user task flows, iterative wireframes, visual research, aesthetic development, high-fidelity styleframes, and a web-ready interactive prototype.

The prototype was built to give viewers an understanding of how Tag might exist as a living ecosystem of players and teams. Powered by AngularJS, the prototype uses several external JSON files to populate players, teams, and matches. I used Python to generate random match data and translate this into a JSON feed for the application.
