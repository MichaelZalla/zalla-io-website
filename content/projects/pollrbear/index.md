PollrBear is a SMS-based mobile platform catering to college students and music fans. With PollrBear, students can be notified of upcoming music concerts near campus, and vote on their favorites. {{< read-more-button >}}

Users can quickly join the platform by entering their phone number through a website. Once registered, a user will start receiving open polls for which they can cast a vote, indicating which concert they are most interested in attending. Polls remain open for a set time window, after which all participants are texted the results of the poll.

*Did we integrate with a 3rd-party API to pull concert information?*

PollrBear was created as part of a course on Cloud Computing at the University of Cincinnati. This was a group project. I worked primarily on the web frontend and *XYZ*. Additional contribution credits go to Nathan Ashcraft, *Y*, and *Z*.
