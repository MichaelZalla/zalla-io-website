A Marginally Eventful Friday Night is a text adventure that I wrote as the final project for Computer Science I (2013). In A Marginally Eventful Friday Night, you play as Nick, a fifth-grader who comes home to find a surprising birthday gift from his absent parents. {{< read-more-button >}}

Taking design cues from old-school text adventures, the game allows the player to progress through the story by entering commands to explore new areas, add items to their inventory, and solve the game as a stateful puzzle.

The source code is written to run through the Python 2.7 interpreter, and was developed using the Eclipse and PyDev IDEs. Game data, including commands, item descriptions, and narrative, is stored as JSON and read by the game.
