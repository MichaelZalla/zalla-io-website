In an RTS game like StarCraft, serious players seek to find and practice build orders in order to improve their play. A build order is an ordered series of commands which a player can issue to achieve a particular position or advantage in-game. {{< read-more-button >}}

StarCraft is a real-time strategy game in which two players—each of a given in-game race—manage resources and build armies that they use to defeat each other. Each race offers a different mix of structures, units, and upgrades that define its core playstyles.

My prototype app, which was created as a short-term project for my Interaction Design II studio course, allows users to browse different build orders, or 'builds', that experienced players develop and use to win at the game StarCraft II.

My app offers users a selection of build orders (ca. 2014) for each race in StarCraft II. Top-level navigation gives the user a choice of race; mid-level navigation provides a list of build order for that race. Finally, the lowest level of navigation details the steps to a specific build order, and offers tactical context and suggestions for play.
